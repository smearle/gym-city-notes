## Using Fractal Neural Networks to Play SimCity 1 and Conway's Game of Life at Variable Scales

This paper was presented at EXAG'19, an AIIDE workshop. It introduces the gym-city learning environment (and the power-puzzle minigame, and 1-player Conway's Game of Life environments), and applies to it a handful of Convolutional Neural Networks, include Fractal Neural Networks. 

## Fractal Automata

This work-in-progress paper attempts to show how Neural Networks might be used to implement various Cellular-Automata. Specifically, we show how to hand-code a recursive CNN to implement a "Physarum"-inspired, CA-based pathfinding algorithm. (I'm doing something similar in the gym-city repo, in GoLMultiEnv, where Conway's Game of Life is implemented as a CNN).
