## FracNNs_SC_GoL

This paper was presented at EXAG'19, an AIIDE workshop. It introduces the gym-city learning environment (and the power-puzzle minigame, and 1-player Conway's Game of Life environments), and applies to it a handful of Convolutional Neural Networks, include Fractal Neural Networks. 

## NN-CAs

This unpublished, work-in-progress paper outlines how Neural Networks might be used to implement various Cellular-Automata. Specifically, we hand-code a recursive CNN to implement a "Physarum"-inspired, CA-based pathfinding algorithm.
